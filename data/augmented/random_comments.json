  "I recently moved into a new rental property and requested a connection well in advance, but the power was not turned on until two days after my scheduled date. During that time, I had to stay elsewhere and incurred additional costs. While the call centre staff were courteous, I felt the internal coordination between departments was lacking and caused unnecessary delays.",
  "The electricity supply itself has been stable, but my concern is with the billing system. Over the last three months, my bills have fluctuated wildly without any clear explanation, despite my usage being fairly consistent. I tried checking the online portal, but the breakdowns were hard to interpret and did not clearly show peak versus off-peak consumption.",
  "I contacted customer support to ask about solar feed-in tariffs, as I recently installed panels on my roof. The agent was friendly but did not seem confident in the information they provided and had to place me on hold multiple times. I eventually got an answer, but it left me unsure whether I am actually receiving the correct credits.",
  "There was a planned outage in my area, but the notification came very late and only via email, which I missed. As a result, my home office setup was disrupted during working hours. I understand outages are sometimes necessary, but clearer and earlier communication through multiple channels would have helped a lot.",
  "Overall, my experience has been positive, especially with the reliability of supply. However, the mobile app feels outdated and slow, making it difficult to quickly check my balance or recent usage. Improving the app usability would significantly enhance the overall customer experience.",
  "I recently received a disconnection warning notice that appeared to be sent in error, as my account was fully paid. This caused unnecessary stress, and it took several phone calls to resolve. While the issue was eventually fixed, I believe such serious notices should have stronger validation checks before being sent.",
  "The technician who came to inspect my meter was professional and explained what he was doing, which I appreciated. However, the appointment window was very broad, and I had to take almost a full day off work to be available. More precise scheduling would make this process much easier for customers.",
  "When I signed up, I was told that my billing cycle would align with my pay schedule, but that never happened. I raised this multiple times through customer service, and each time I was told it would be corrected in the next cycle, which never occurred. This inconsistency has been frustrating.",
  "I experienced a power outage late at night, and while the online outage map acknowledged it quickly, there was little follow-up communication. I would have liked periodic updates even if there was no new information, just to know the issue was still being worked on.",
  "The customer portal provides a lot of data, but it is not very intuitive. For example, comparing my current usage to last year takes several clicks and is not visually clear. Better charts and summaries would make it much easier to understand my consumption patterns.",
  "I contacted Synergy to ask about hardship support options due to temporary financial difficulties. The representative was empathetic and took the time to explain the available plans without making me feel uncomfortable. This was a very positive experience during a stressful time.",
  "Despite setting up direct debit, my last payment failed without any notification until I saw a late fee on my bill. I would have appreciated an SMS or email alert so I could fix the issue before being penalised.",
  "The estimated bill I received was significantly higher than usual, and it turned out the meter read was incorrect. Although the correction was eventually made, the process took several weeks and multiple follow-ups, which was quite inconvenient.",
  "I appreciate the efforts Synergy is making toward renewable energy, but I find it hard to access clear information about how my household can participate more actively. The website has bits of information scattered around rather than a single, clear guide.",
  "The live chat feature on the website is useful, but the waiting time can be very long during peak hours. On one occasion, I waited over 40 minutes only to be disconnected and had to start again.",
  "I recently upgraded to a smart meter, and the installation process itself was smooth. However, the promised real-time usage data took weeks to appear in my account, and no one could give me a clear explanation as to why.",
  "My main frustration has been with inconsistent advice from different customer service agents. Depending on who I speak to, I receive different answers to the same question, which makes it hard to trust the information provided.",
  "On the positive side, outages in my area are rare, and when they do happen, restoration is usually faster than expected. This reliability is one of the main reasons I have stayed with Synergy.",
  "I tried to change my contact details through the online portal, but the changes did not save properly. I only realised this when I missed an important notification, which could have been avoided with a more reliable system.",
  "The paper bill layout is cluttered and difficult to read, especially for elderly members of my household. A clearer design with larger fonts and simpler summaries would be more accessible.",
  "I had an issue with incorrect concession details on my account, which meant I was not receiving the discount I was entitled to. Resolving this required submitting documents multiple times, as they kept getting marked as incomplete without clear reasons.",
  "The outage alerts via SMS are helpful, but sometimes they arrive after the power has already gone out. Receiving alerts slightly earlier would allow customers to prepare better.",
  "When I lodged a complaint through the website, I received an automated confirmation but no follow-up for over a week. It would be reassuring to know the expected response timeframe upfront.",
  "The overall cost of electricity is high, which I understand is influenced by many factors, but clearer explanations of price increases would help customers feel more informed rather than surprised.",
  "I found the comparison between different plans confusing, as the differences were explained using technical terms. A plain-language comparison with example households would be very helpful.",
  "The agent I spoke with regarding my final bill after moving out was excellent and resolved everything in a single call. This efficiency made the move much less stressful.",
  "I have noticed that estimated bills are becoming more frequent in my area, and they are often inaccurate. This makes budgeting difficult and reduces confidence in the billing process.",
  "The website accessibility could be improved, particularly for screen readers. Navigating certain sections feels unnecessarily complicated.",
  "I appreciate the sustainability tips included in the newsletters, but they often feel generic. More personalised advice based on my actual usage would be more valuable.",
  "After a recent storm, the power was out for an extended period. While I understand the circumstances, communication during the outage was minimal, leaving many residents frustrated.",
  "The process for disputing a bill is not very clear on the website, and I had to search through several pages to find the right form. Simplifying this would improve the experience.",
  "I have generally had a good experience, but response times during peak summer periods seem to drop significantly. Additional staffing during these times might help.",
  "The automatic phone system is difficult to navigate, and it often takes several attempts to reach the right department. This adds to the overall frustration when calling for support.",
  "I was pleased with how quickly my gas connection was handled compared to electricity, which seemed to involve more delays and confusion.",
  "The notifications about upcoming maintenance work were clear and detailed, which I appreciated. This allowed me to plan around the interruption.",
  "I find it challenging to understand how my usage compares to similar households, as the benchmarks provided are vague and not well explained.",
  "The support agent I dealt with during a billing dispute was knowledgeable and patient, which made a big difference in resolving the issue calmly.",
  "I would like to see more proactive communication when there are known system issues affecting the online portal, rather than discovering them myself.",
  "The sign-up process was straightforward, but the welcome information pack contained a lot of jargon that was hard to follow.",
  "I had to repeat my issue multiple times after being transferred between departments, which suggests that internal notes are not being shared effectively.",
  "The energy-saving recommendations in my account are useful, but I am not sure how accurate they are without more context on how they are calculated.",
  "I experienced a brief outage that was not listed on the outage map, which made me wonder how comprehensive the reporting is.",
  "Overall, I feel Synergy provides a reliable service, but there is room for improvement in communication, transparency, and digital experience.",
  "The delay in processing my meter read adjustment caused confusion and made me doubt whether my issue was being actively handled.",
  "I appreciate the polite tone of communications, but sometimes the emails are too long and bury the key information.",
  "The follow-up survey after my support interaction was easy to complete, and I felt it genuinely reflected my experience.",
  "While the frontline staff are generally helpful, the systems they use seem to slow them down, leading to longer call times."
