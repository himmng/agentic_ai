The account billing appeared incorrect on my latest statement, which caused confusion and extra follow-up. The outage events were poorly communicated, so I found myself waiting for an update that never arrived. The support team eventually clarified some details, but the resolution left me unsatisfied. Overall, this experience was not what I expected, and I am concerned about future bills.",
