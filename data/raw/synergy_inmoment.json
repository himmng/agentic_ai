I contacted customer support by phone and was told a manual adjustment would be processed. The representative explained that the adjustment would take two billing cycles, which felt unfair given the error was on your side. I kept paying the incorrect amount while waiting for the fix, which caused financial stress. I checked my account online and saw several line items I did not recognize, which added to my confusion. The process took longer than promised, and I had to repeat details several times. I would like the erroneous charges refunded and a clear explanation of how the billing error occurred. I hope this helps prevent similar issues for other customers."
