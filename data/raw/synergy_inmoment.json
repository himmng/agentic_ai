The billing statement listed a higher consumption during a period when I do not recall any service interruptions or changes to my plan. I contacted customer service to ask for a breakdown of the items and the calculation method used. The agent checked the account and mentioned a possible adjustment, but I did not receive a formal explanation or a corrected bill yet. I was asked to wait for a credit, and I was given a reference number that did not resolve the issue immediately. The process felt slow, and I had to follow up again to understand the time frame for the credit. I would appreciate clearer communication and a transparent calculation of each line item on future bills. Overall, the experience with the billing portion could be improved."

The information about due dates, late fees, and eligible discounts was buried under several clicks, which made it easy to miss critical dates. I would benefit from a more prominent display of upcoming charges and a simple way to compare plans side by side. When I requested a written explanation, the agent provided a generic response instead of a detailed breakdown tailored to my account. An improved portal with clearer steps and printable summaries would help reduce back-and-forth. I understand incentives exist to retain customers, but plain language and faster resolution to billing questions would greatly improve my perception of the service. The experience could be improved with proactive alerts when a bill is generated and when a credit is applied. I am open to receiving a summarized monthly bill in a consistent format."

The agent walked me through the steps to correct the issue and confirmed the credit would appear on the next statement. The conversation covered the timing of the correction and the expected posting date. I also asked about how similar errors could be prevented in the future, and the representative shared information about the upcoming portal improvements. The portal navigation while viewing the same billing period was straightforward, and I could locate the relevant charge under the transactions tab. The overall experience involved several confirmations and I noted the reference numbers provided during the call. The outcome was satisfactory because the duplicate charge was resolved and I received confirmation via email."
