    "text": "Overall, I am very happy with Synergy's service. The price and billing are clear most of the time, and I appreciate the straightforward statements. The mobile app, however, crashed several times when I tried to check my usage. It sometimes takes too long to load my account details, which is frustrating during peak hours. Despite these app issues, the support team was friendly and resolved questions quickly, and I still feel confident about the service.",

    "text": "I found the service adequate for my needs, with no major surprises. The billing process was a bit confusing at times, and I would appreciate clearer explanations of changes. There have been small outages in my area that affected my usage, though the service generally recovered quickly. The pricing conversation hasn't been very clear, which left me with questions about my bill. Overall, I feel neutral about the experience and hope communication improves in the next quarter.",

The outages in my area have been frequent and disruptive, making it hard to rely on the service for critical needs. The online portal is slow and unhelpful, which makes tracking usage frustrating. I feel the company is failing to communicate clearly about price changes and outage notices, and I am considering switching providers.",
